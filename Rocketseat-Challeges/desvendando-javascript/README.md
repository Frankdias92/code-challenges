# Project Documentation "Desvendando JavaScript"

## Overview

The "Desvendando JavaScript" project is a web application developed in Next.js that allows users to interact with different types of forms and inputs. The application includes features for sending data to a server, processing responses, and displaying dynamic results in the user interface.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Forms:** Users can interact with two fields, one input to enter their name and another to perform a sequence of function calculations.
- **Data Processing:** Data submitted by users is processed by the server, and the responses are dynamically displayed in the interface.
- **Results Display:** The results are displayed clearly and organized in the interface, allowing users to easily understand the processed information.
